                    Creating Our Own Sequence Types

At it's most basic, an immutable sequence type should support two things:

    returning the length of the sequence    (technically, I don't even really need that!)
    given an index, returning the element of that index.
            (If i Have an object that can provide, given an index, = the element at that index. It's a sequence)

    No matter how I store the data internally, it doesn't have to be stored in the list or anything like that.

If an object provides this functionality, the we should in theory be able to:
    retrieve elements by index using square brackets. []
        "That's our goal, to be able to use that square brackets. []
        Iterate through the elements using python's native looping mechanisms.
            e.g. for loops, list,  comprehensions, etc.


                        How Python does it

Sequence types, at a minimum, implements the following methods:
    __len
