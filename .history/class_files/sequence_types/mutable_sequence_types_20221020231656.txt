                        Mutating objects

Mutating an object means changing the object's state without creating a new object.


        Mutating Using []

s[i]= x         element at index i is replaced with x

s[i:j] = s2     slice is replaced by the contents of the iterable s2

del s[i]        removes element at index i

del s[i:j]      removes entire slice

We can even assign to extended slices:      s[i:j:k] = s2



        Some methods supported by mutable sequence types suvh as lists

s.clear()           removes all items from s

s.append(x)         appends x to the end of s

s.insert(i, x)      inserts x at index i

s.extend(iterable)  appends contents of iterable to the end of s

s.pop(i)            removes element at index i

s. remove(x)        removes the first occurrence of x in s

s.reverse()
