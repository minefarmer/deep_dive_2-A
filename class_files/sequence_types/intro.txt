                        What are sequences

Indexing starting at 0
slices include lower bound index, but exclude upper bound index
slicing
slice objects
modifying mutable sequences
copying sequences - shallow and deep
implementing custom sequence types
sorting
list comprehensions



                        Built-in Sequence types

mutable     lists       bytearrays

immutable   strings     tuples     bytes
                           \         \
                            \        more limited than lists, strings and tuples
                             \
                              in reality a tuple is more than just a sequence type


Additional standard types:      collections package     namedtuple
                                                        deque

                                array module            array



                        Homogeneous vs Heterogeneous Sequences

Strings are homogeneous sequences
    each element is of the same type (a character)      'python


Lists are heterogeneous sequences
    each element may be of a different type     [1. 10.5. 'python']



Homogeneous sequence types are usually more efficient (storage wise at least)
    e.g. prefer using a string of characters, rather than a list or tuple of characters


What does it mean for an object to be iterable?
    it is a container type of object and we can list out the elements in that object ine by one.

So any sequence type is iterable.
    l = [1, 2, 3]       for e in l
                        l[0]

But an iterable is not necessarily a sequence type   -> iterables are more general

    s = {1, 2, 3}       for e in s
\
                        s[0] (X) = is not available



                            Standard Sequence Methods
Built-in sequence types, both mutable and immutable, support the following methods.

x in s              s1 +s2      concatenation
x not in            s * n (or n * s)        (n an integer)      repition


len(s)              min(s)
                            (if an ordering between elements of s is defined)
                    max(s)
                            This is not the same as the ordering (position) of elements
                            inside the container, this is the ability to compare pairwise
                            elements using an order comparision (e.g. <, <=, etc.)


s.index(x)          index of first occurrence of x in s

s.index(x, i)       index of first occurrence of x in s at or after index i

s.index(x, i, j)    index of first occurrence of x in s at or after index i and before index j

s[i]        the element at index i

s[i:j]      the slice from index i, to (but not including) j

s[i:j:k]    extended slice from index i, to (but not including) j, in steps of k

Note: Slices will return in the same container type.


range objects are more restrictive:
    no concatenation / repetition
    min, max, in, not in not as efficient



                        Hashing

Immutable sequence types may support hashing  hash(s)
    but not if they contain mutable types!



                        Beware of Concatenations

x = [1, 2]          a = x + x       a -> [1, 2, 1, 2]

x = 'python'        a = x + x       a -> 'pythonpython'

             # this object is mutable    (Characters are immutable, integers  ar immutable here)
            /
x = [ [0, 0] ]      a = x + x       a -> [ [0, 0], [0, 0] ]
         \                                     /       \
        /                                     /         \          a[0] is x[0]
        \                                    /           \         a[1] is x[0]
     id(x[0])   ==                     id(a[0])      id(a[1])

    a[0][0] = 100       a -> [  [100, 0], [100, 0]]



                        Beware of Repetitions

a = [1, 2] * 2      a -> [1, 2, 1, 2]

a = 'python' * 2    s -> 'pythonpython'

x = [ [0, 0] ]      a = x + x       a -> [ [0, 0], [0, 0] ]
         \                                     /       \
        /                                     /         \          a[0] is x[0]
        \                                    /           \         a[1] is x[0]
     id(x[0])   ==                     id(a[0])      id(a[1])


a = [0][0]  =  100         a -> [ [100, 0], [100. 0]]
